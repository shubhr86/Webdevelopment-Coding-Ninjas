			<h2>Paragraph on Environment in 100 Words</h2>
			<p>Our environment is nature’s most precious and vital gift, and it needs to be handled with utmost care. It is the natural ecological system where we live, depending on each other for survival. The environment is divided into physical and biological components. The atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere constitute the physical category, and the biological category comprises human beings and other living beings. In simple terms, the environment is defined as the combination and interrelation between all biotic and abiotic components. The ecosystem of our environment needs to be maintained in a proper balance, and if any part of it is disturbed, the whole ecosystem gets affected.

			<h2>Paragraph on Environment in 150 Words</h2>
			<p>
			The environment refers to the surroundings in which life exists on earth. Components like animals, humans, sunlight, water, trees, and air make up the environment. They are the earth’s living and non-living components. Living organisms include trees, humans, and animals. Non-living components such as the sun, water and air are essential for man’s life.
			</p>
			<p>
			Both living and non-living organisms are dependent on each other to maintain a balanced ecosystem. A disturbance in any of the categories will create chaos in the entire ecosystem and threaten the environment. Just like the growing human population has become a threat to the environment. Global warming is a major threat to the environment. The atmosphere and hydrosphere, on the other hand, are components of the environment that have an impact on the lives of living things. The atmosphere contains gases like oxygen and nitrogen. Every living being is developed according to the characteristics of these components. Aquatic species, for example, are designed to breathe underwater. Aerial animals are designed to live in the air. So even the tiniest change in nature’s subtle balance makes it difficult for living organisms to survive in the environment it is designed to live in.

			<h2>Paragraph on Environment in 200 Words</h2>
			<p>
			The environment is the natural world around an organism that allows it to survive. The French word ‘environ,’ which means ‘to surround,’ is derived from the English word ‘environment.’ It is made up of living creatures like plants, animals, and human beings. The non-living elements of the environment are air, water, and land. Nature has designed its functioning in such a way that everything is interdependent. Human beings are the most powerful of all the creatures that rely on and make use of the earth’s natural resources. Air is required for the survival of not just humans but also plants and animals. Without air, there will be no life on Earth. Human beings alone are responsible for the degradation of the environment. The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere are the different layers that make up the environment. Several gases, like oxygen and nitrogen, that are required for life are found in the atmosphere. The hydrosphere is made up of different water bodies like rivers, oceans, seas, etc. The lithosphere is the earth’s outermost layer, which is made up of rock and soil. The biosphere is home to all living beings. The environment is influenced by a variety of elements, some of which are natural and others man-made.
